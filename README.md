# Minimal React Boilerplate
Yet another React boilerplate, configured for personal preferences for rapid prototyping. Lightweight with the bare minimum I need for most quick applications.

## Features
- [x] Hot Reloading
- [x] CSS Modules
- [x] ES6
- [x] React

## Potential Addons
- Flux: Redux + ImmutableJS + Reselect +...
Redux often adds too much unnecessary boilerplate / complexity. Most of my simple experiments do not require these tools, and I currently plan to only add them when the project gets too big. Otherwise I might just switch to using [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/).

- Tests
Tests are definitely important in maintaining large codebases, but not so much for quick experiments, however I'm considering adding a default testing framework as it's good practice.

- React Router
Definitely considering this one
